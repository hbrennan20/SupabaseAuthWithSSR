## Features

- **Robust Authentication**: Utilize Supabase's comprehensive auth capabilities alongside SSR for enhanced security.
- **Performance**: Leverage server-side rendering for faster load times and improved user experience.
- **Next.js Integration**: Specifically designed for easy integration with Next.js 14 projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A [Supabase account](https://supabase.io/)
- An existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElectricCodeGuy/SupabaseAuthWithSSR.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd SupabaseAuthWithSSR
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Database Setup

Before launching your application, you must configure the database schema within Supabase.

1. **Create the Users Table**

   ```sql
   create table users (
     -- UUID from auth.users
     id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
     full_name text,
   );
   ```

   This SQL statement creates a `users` table with columns for storing user data such as `id`, `full_name`. The `id` column is a foreign key referencing the `auth.users` table.

2. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)**

   ```sql
   alter table users enable row level security;
   create policy "Can view own user data." on users for select using (auth.uid() = id);
   create policy "Can update own user data." on users for update using (auth.uid() = id);
   ```

   These SQL statements enable Row Level Security (RLS) on the `users` table and create policies to allow users to view and update their own data.

3. **Create a Trigger Function**

   ```sql
   create function public.handle_new_user()
   returns trigger as $$
   begin
     insert into public.users (id, full_name)
     values (new.id, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name');
     return new;
   end;
   $$ language plpgsql security definer;
   ```

   This SQL function is a trigger function that automatically inserts a new user entry into the `public.users` table when a new user signs up via Supabase Auth. It extracts the `id`, `full_name` from the `auth.users` table and inserts them into the corresponding columns in the `public.users` table.

4. **Create a Trigger**

   ```sql
   create trigger on_auth_user_created
     after insert on auth.users
     for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
   ```

   This SQL statement creates a trigger named `on_auth_user_created` that executes the `public.handle_new_user()` function after each new user is inserted into the `auth.users` table.

5. **Sign Up for an Account**

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth` in your web browser.
   - Use the sign-up form to create an account. Ensure you use a valid email address that you have access to, as you'll need to verify it in the next step.

6. **Verify Your Email**

   - After signing up, Supabase will send an email to the address you provided. Check your inbox for an email from Supabase or your application.
   - Open the email and click on the verification link to confirm your email address. This step is crucial for activating your account and ensuring that you can log in and access the application's features.

## Setting Up the Error Feedback Database in Supabase OPTIONAL

### Step 1: Create the `error_feedback` Table

To store error feedback data, execute this SQL query in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
CREATE TABLE error_feedback (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    feedback TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    errorMessage TEXT,
    errorStack TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This table will store feedback messages, their categories, any associated error messages, and the error stack trace to help with debugging.

### Step 2: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

1. **Enable RLS for the `error_feedback` table**:

   - Navigate to `Authentication` > `Policies` in your Supabase project dashboard.
   - Select the `error_feedback` table and enable RLS.

2. **Create an RLS policy for inserts (Optional)**:
   - If you want to restrict who can insert data into this table, you can create a policy.
   - Click "New Policy", provide a name like `Allow feedback insertion`.
   - Set the **Policy Definition** to allow `INSERT` operations.
   - For the **Using expression**, you could use `(auth.role() = 'authenticated')` to only allow authenticated users to insert feedback.
   - Leave the **Check expression** as is if no further restrictions are needed or adjust according to your requirements.
   - Ensure the **Policy Command** is set to `INSERT`.

### Environment Variables

Configure your environment by renaming `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and updating it with your Supabase project details:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon (public) key.

Optional variables for extended functionality:

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID`
- `CLIENT_SECRET`

For third-party auth configurations, include:

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_SECRET_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_SECRET_ID`

For Openai, Perplexity and Upstash/Redis

- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=`
